A few [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts I find useful enough to keep re-using.

Used Daily
----------

 * **CMD-paste_ctrl-shift-v** - paste to command prompt window with `Ctrl-V` (Author: Lowell Heddings)
 * **ToggleHiddenFiles** - tell Windows Explorer to show/hide hidden files with a simple `Winkey-H`  (Author: A.N.Other)



Useful when needed
------------------


* **Onenote-export-section-as-mht** - Export the current section of a OneNote document as compiled html (.mht). My first use of [Pulover's Macro Creator](http://www.macrocreator.com/) (very favourable impression so far!)

 


Falling into bit-rot
--------------------


 * **VolumeOSD** - Volume On-Screen-Display (OSD) for Windows 7 (Author: Rajat) *doesn't work for me anymore, and haven't felt compelled to investigate or fix yet*
